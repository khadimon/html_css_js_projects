# 50 Years of Life Project

This project is a celebratory webpage designed to honor a special occasion, featuring animations that depict the growth of a rose as a metaphor for life and love.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the webpage. It includes references to the CSS and JavaScript files and contains the content for the different scenes of the animation.

- **css/styles.css**: This file contains the styles for the project. It defines the layout, colors, animations, and other visual aspects of the webpage. Modifications are needed to create the desired rose animation effect.

- **js/script.js**: This file contains the JavaScript code that controls the animation and scene transitions. It handles user interactions and dynamically generates the rose elements. Updates are required to create the rose animations similar to the reference video.

- **assets/fonts**: This directory is intended for storing any custom fonts used in the project. Include font files if you want to use specific typography.
